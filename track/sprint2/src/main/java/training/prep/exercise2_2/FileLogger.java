/**
 * ✍️Exercise 2.2 - Abstraction in Code
 * Start with this class, for a logging system:
 *
 * class FileLogger {
 *   private boolean fileOpen = false;
 *   public void openFile() {
 *     if (fileOpen) {
 *       throw new IllegalStateException("File already open");
 *     }
 *     System.out.println("Opening log file...");
 *     fileOpen = true;
 *   }
 *   public void writeLine(String line) {
 *     if (!fileOpen) {
 *       throw new IllegalStateException("Cannot write - file not open");
 *     }
 *     System.out.println("LOG: " + line);
 *   }
 *   public void closeFile() {
 *     if (!fileOpen) {
 *       throw new IllegalStateException("File already closed");
 *     }
 *     System.out.println("Closing log file...");
 *     fileOpen = false;
 *   }
 * }
 * In your main method, use FileLogger directly to log a message:
 *
 * Create a FileLogger instance
 * Call openFile()
 * Call writeLine() with a message
 * Call closeFile()
 * Think about the following:
 *
 * Try calling writeLine() before openFile(), what happens and why?
 * If this were a real logger implementation, what might happen if another developer forgets to call closeFile()?
 * Create a new class called ApplicationLogger, which will provide an abstraction over FileLogger:
 *
 * Create a single method in this logger which calls each method on FileLogger in the correct order
 * Update main() to use ApplicationLogger instead of FileLogger directly, checking that logging still works
 * We now have a new requirement for the ApplicationLogger - the ability to log out [INFO] and [ERROR] level logs:
 *
 * Refactor the existing method you’ve created to prepend the logged message with [INFO] and call it logInfo
 * Create a new method called logError which prepends [ERROR]
 * Use these new methods in your main() method
